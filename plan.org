* Tasks
** Master process
*** Task object with complexity
*** `Stop message` passing
*** `Continue message` passing
*** Decide procedure
**** Total weight over threshold (T)
**** ;; Variance of Comp Load over threshold (TLd)
**** Variance of weight over threshold as secondary parameter
*** Migration procedure (move the fattest task)
**** Send a message to a task sender
** Slave process
*** Getting load info
*** Computing remaining tasks weight
*** Sending info to master
*** Migration procedure
**** Receive message from master
**** Serialize an identified task
**** Send it to specified node
*** Ability to stop and continue work
